This code is an example of the use of platform events.


Use platform events to connect processes in Salesforce and external apps through the exchange of real-time event data.

Platform events are based on the publish/subscribe model and work directly with a message bus which handles the queue of incoming events and processes listening for them. This is built in real time integration patterns in the Salesforce Platform which helps to reduce point-to-point integration.
